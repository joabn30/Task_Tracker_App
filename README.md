This Task Tracking App is a simple and interactive User Interface (UI) that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can create tasks by entering a task name along with a description, view their task list, update existing tasks, mark them as Pending or Completed, and delete them when finished.

The app leverages a RESTful API built with Node.js to perform full CRUD operations — including POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE. This API serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend, handling data persistence and updates dynamically.

Setup Instruction:
-Add a task: Enter a task name and description in the input fields.Click the "Add" button to save it.
-Edit a Task: Click a task to select it. Press the "Update" button and enter new values when prompted.
-Check Status: Click the "Tickmark" (✔) button next to a task to toggle between Pending and Completed.
-Delete a Task:Click a task to select it. Press the "Delete" button. Or click the "x" next to a task to delete it instantly.
