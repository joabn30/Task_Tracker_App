This Task Tracking App is a simple and interactive User Interface (UI) that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create tasks by entering a task name along with a description, view their task list, update existing tasks, mark them as Pending or Completed, and delete them when finished.

The app leverages a RESTful API built with Node.js to perform full CRUD operations — including POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE. This API serves as the bridge between the frontend and backend, handling data persistence and updates dynamically.

Setup Instruction:
1.) Backend (Node.js API): Ensure Node.js is installed.Download from nodejs.org if needed.
2.) Install dependencies: Open a terminal in the root of the project and run "npm install express cors body-parser".
3.) Run the following command in the terminal "node API.js".
4.)Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to launch the app.
